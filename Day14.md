# DAY14 | Preorder/Inorder/Postorder Traversal

## [144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)
## [145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)
## [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

### Note:
- How to remember the order of each traversal method?
  The answer is the name indicate the `middle node` of every signle tree.
- There are two way to traversal a binary tree: 1) Recursion; 2) Iteration
- In the Iteration method, we use `while` and a stack data structure to execute the process. Remember to add `None` after a `middle node`
