# DAY16 | Recursion in Binary Tree
## [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
### [559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/description/)
### Note
- Make clear the difference between 'height' and 'depth'. 'Height' is bottom-up, 'depth' is top-down.
- Preorder traversal calculate the 'depth'
- Postorder traversal calculate the 'height'
- The maximum height == the maximum depth
